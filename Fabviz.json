Our work exemplifies the design of physical artifacts that subsequently aid in digital design and fabrication. Bend-a-rule is a ruler, fabricated by laser-cutting a periodic pattern on a rigid board. \n\tThe ruler has unidirectional flexibility, and readily bends to conform to the shape of curved planar contours on physical 3D objects. \n\tWe present a novel workflow, by which this curved planar contour can be digitally acquired from a single image of the physical ruler. The acquired contour is then used to design laser-cut accessory shapes that attach to physcial 3D objects along the digitally acquired contour.\n\t[...]",

   "Abstract": "We propose a complete process for designing, simulating, and fabricating synthetic skin for an animatronics character that mimics the face of a given subject and its expressions. The process starts with measuring the elastic properties of a material used to manufacture synthetic soft tissue. Given these measurements we use physics-based simulation to predict the behavior of a face when it is driven by the underlying robotic actuation.  [...]",

   "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for converting 3D models into printable, functional, non-assembly models with internal friction. To this end, we have designed an intuitive work-flow that takes an appropriately rigged 3D model, automatically fits novel 3D-printable and posable joints, and provides an interface for specifying rotational constraints. We show a number of results for different articulated models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.  [...]",

   "Abstract": "3D printing technology is rapidly maturing and becoming ubiquitous. One of the remaining obstacles to wide-scale adoption is that the object to be printed must fit into the working volume of the 3D printer. We propose a framework, called Chopper, to decompose a large 3D object into smaller parts so that each part fits into the printing volume. These parts can then be assembled to form the original object.  [...]",

   "Abstract": "We illustrate process developments with an account of the production of printer parts to cope with polymer fillers that are hard and abrasive; new nozzles with ruby inserts designed for such materials are durable and can be used to print boron carbide composites. As with other materials, complex parts can be printed using boron carbide composites with fine structures, such as screw threads and labels to identify materials.  [...]",

   "Abstract": "We introduce an interactive interface for the custom design of metallophones. \n\tThe shape of each plate must be determined \n\tin the design process so that the metallophone will produce the proper tone when struck with a mallet. \n\tOur system addresses this problem by running a concurrent numerical eigenanalysis during interactive geometry editing.

   "Authors": "Karl D.D. Willis, Cheng Xu, Kuan-Ju Wu, Golan Levin,  Mark D. Gros",
   "Abstract": "We present a series of prototype devices that use real-time input to fabricate physical form: Interactive Fabrication. Our work maps out the problem space of real-time control for digital fabrication devices, and examines where alternative interfaces for digital fabrication are relevant. We conclude by reflecting upon the potential of interactive fabrication and outline a number of considerations for future research in this area.  [...]",
